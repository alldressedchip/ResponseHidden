# ResponseHidden
 
A proposed Chrome Extension that would be used by members of the Talent team. This extension hides information on Lever.com profiles so that interviewers cannot see it when accessing the candidate's profile. We are required to hide this information in order to maintain candidate privacy.

Contact me via slack @alldressedchip for more info.
